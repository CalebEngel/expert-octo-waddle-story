Deep in the woods somewhere in the northern tip of Wisconsin lived a wild Yorkie Poo by the name of Vivian. Vivian was held in the highest esteem by local lore. There wasn't a bar in a 100 mile radius that didn't have a picture of this pup plastered somewhere above the bar keep. It wasn't always this way though and not a sigle soul can either confirm nor deny the acconts that follow. Lets being on a brisk winter night. A night so cold you could one felt as if they were only living creature. As if they had been planted on a different planet. This, believe it or not, was where Vivian thrived.

Vivian felt pretty confident that they were the only living creature out this night. This was because Vivian was the only one in town who was ever brave enough to go outside when it got this cold out. This was bad for the local bars because no one was coming in to drink when it got cold! The story goes that Vivian started offering their services when it got to cold out. Vivian would brave the cold no matter the distance to deliver you a nice cold drink from the bar if you would only do one thing for them.
